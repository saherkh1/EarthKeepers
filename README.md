## Overview

The EarthKeeper application was developed by the second-place winning team at the EcoHack competition. It is designed to encourage people to clean up waste and maintain cleanliness in exchange for financial rewards. Users can capture "before" and "after" pictures of the cleaned-up area and upload them through the app. In return, they earn points equivalent to monetary rewards. The more active users are in environmental preservation, the more points they accumulate.

## 🌍 Features

- **Photo Capture**: Users can take pictures of a location before and after cleaning it up.
- **Upload Functionality**: The app allows users to upload the pictures directly to the platform.
- **Point System**: Users earn points based on their activity and contribution to environmental cleanliness.
- **Monetary Rewards**: Points earned can be converted into monetary rewards.
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Users can report litterbugs anonymously, with the reporter receiving a share of the penalty imposed.
